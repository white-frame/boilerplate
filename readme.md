## WhiteFrame Framework Boilerplate

This project is a starting point showing the usage of the full power of the [WhiteFrame/Helloquent](https://github.com/white-frame/helloquent) Model and the [WhiteFrame/Http](https://github.com/white-frame/http) Controller. In a few lines you have a full example of a User management project : 

* **Action** : listing, creating, editing and deleting eloquent models.
* **Flash message** : Simple action confirmation based on [Laracast/Flash](https://github.com/laracasts/flash) (not included in the project)
* **RESTful URL** : With built-in resource controller
